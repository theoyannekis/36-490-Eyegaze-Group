In general, the only case where the MANOVA test result gave a significant result was when the average away from text variable was run against order. However, when running the summary statistic on the one case where the initial MANOVA result gave a significant result, running an analysis of the effect of order on each of the response variable actually resulted in no significant result. 
We think that the MANOVA outputs in general is not an accurate description of the data because our data violates some of the important assumptions, such as the linearity of the variables. We decided to focus on other methods to check the importance of variables in predicting the result.
